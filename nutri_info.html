          <h2>Health and Nutrition Information</h2>
          <p1>Your nutrition is an imperative aspect in keeping you healthy. The purpose of this app is to calculate your current status through BMI and provide information to keep or improve your current health.</p1>
          <p1>Maintaining a healthy eating lifestyle requires a balanced diet and adequate physical activity. Generally, you should aim to:</p1>
            <li style="text-align:left">Consume lots of fruit and vegetables</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">Eat more whole-grain foods compared to refined-grain</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">Drink low fat milk</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">Cut back on sugary drinks and drink more water</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">Choose a range of lean protein foods</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">Keep sodium food levels in mind</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">Cut back on fats</li>
          <p1>However, it is obvious that different people have different needs and functions. If your BMI is very high or very low, it is advised to seek help from professionals. A dietician and fitness instructor will also be beneficial to seek further support in your nutrition and health journey.</p1>
